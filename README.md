Triangle : a C program “triangle.c” that uses the “*” character to draw a triangle of a given number of rows.
The program first prompts the user to enter the number of rows in the triangle.

Caesar: a C program “caesar.c” that encrypts a message using one of the oldest known encryption
techniques, called Caesar cipher, attributed to Julius Caesar. It involves replacing each letter in a
message with another letter that is a fixed number of positions later in the alphabet (shift). If the
replacement would go past the letter Z, the cipher “wraps around” to the beginning of the alphabet.The user will enter the message
to be encrypted and the shift amount as a valid integer from 1 to 25 (inclusive).

Anagram: a C program “anagram.c” that tests whether two words are anagrams (permutations of the same
letters).

Random Walk: a C program “rw.c” that generates a random walk across a 10x10 array. Initially, the array will
contain only dot characters (‘.’). The program must randomly “walk” from element to element, always
going up, down, left, or right by one step. The elements visited by the program will be labeled with the
letters A through Z, in the order visited.
